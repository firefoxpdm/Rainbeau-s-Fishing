  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Fishing"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 12/05/2018
	- Fish meat from this mod can once again be used to make sushi items from
	  "Vegetable Garden," if that mod is installed.
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.

- 12/01/2018
	- Ice fishing spots can now also be constructed on ice tiles generated by
	  "Nature's Pretty Sweet."
	- Non-generic fish can now be caught in the biomes introduced by "Realistic
	  Planets," as well as in similarly-named biomes introduced by other mods.

- 11/11/2018
	- Added "ice fishing spots" which can be constructed on frozen river or lake
	  water tiles generated by my own "Permafrost" mod or Fumblesneeze's "Ice" 
	  mod. Note that ice fishing spots cannot be placed on vanilla ice tiles,
	  and will appear on the "Production" tab of the Architect menu only if one
	  or both of the "freezing" mods are actually in your mod list.
	- Shellfish traps will no longer be destroyed if the tile beneath them dries
	  up, but will instead simply stop working. If the tile freezes, they'll
	  still operate, but more slowly than otherwise.
	
- 11/03/2018
	- Reduced the ingredient nutrition cost of the seafood meals slightly, and
	  increased the mood buffs, to put them between fine and lavish vanilla meals
	  in terms of efficiency and benefit.
	- Shellfish traps are now "stuffable," and can be made from vanilla wood or
	  from any wood added by mods.
	- Shellfish traps are now minifiable and movable.
	- If the tile under a fishing spot becomes any terrain other than water, the
	  fishing spot will now be destroyed. (This applies to changes due to use of
	  dev mode, moisture pumps, terraforming "spells," etc.) Similarly, if the
	  terrain under a shellfish trap becomes anything other than water, the trap
	  will be destroyed, unless the change is simply due to the water freezing to
	  ice as a result of the terrain changes allowed by my "Permafrost" mod.
	  
- 10/20/2018
	- Added sliders on the options menu to adjust the basic "efficiency" of both
	  pawn fishing and shellfish traps.
	- Use of the mod's seafood recipes can now be turned off in the configuration
	  menu, so those who want only vanilla meal recipes available at their stoves
	  can make it so.
	- If either "Feed the Colonists" or "Simple Bulk Cooking" is in use, seafood
	  meals will be available for production in batches of four, just as are
	  vanilla meals.
	- Carrion crawlers (giant snails) from "Monster Mash" now yield the same
	  snail meat when butchered as do regular snails. They just yield a lot more
	  of it.
	  
- 10/14/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld 1.0 release!
	- Pawns who hate violence will now refuse to fish, just as those who hate
	  animals already did.
	- Fixed shellfish trap timing; they were taking twice as long as intended to 
	  have a chance to catch something (up to 4.5 days in base biomes, as opposed
	  to just over two days intended maximum).
	- Updated some of the mod's graphics (primarily to utilize StackCounts).
	
- 09/21/2018
	- Squashed the bug that was preventing fishing spots from being placed on, 
	  and shellfish traps from being placed adjacent to, bridges from my 
	  "Advanced Bridges" mod.
	- Clarified the fishing spot "bad placement" message, replacing the reference
	  to the "blue circle" (which doesn't actually appear until *after* the spot
	  is successfully placed) with "mouse cursor."
	- Updated the Japanese language files.
	  
- 09/16/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld b19 release.
	- Removed the dependency on "Basic Bridges." Fishing spots can now be placed
	  on any land (or bridge) tile adjacent to water; they don't need to be
	  located on bridges or boardwalks from the other mod. Similarly, shellfish
	  traps simply need to be located in water adjacent to a land (or bridge)
	  tile.
	- Removed the "Vegetable Garden" seafood patches, at least for now, as the
	  old ones from b18 almost certainly won't work, anyway.
	- Removed "Mod Sync Ninja" files.

- 01/09/2018
	- OK, now, shellfish can actually be butchered.

- 01/07/2018
	- Updated the Japanese language translation files.
	
- 01/06/2018
	- Updated most of the fish graphics.
	- Added bass and catfish.
	- Increased the mood buff from eating sushi, since its ingredient cost is a
	  bit higher than for comparable foods.
	- Unbutchered shellfish can no longer be used as ingredients in simple meals.
	  However, shellfish *can* now be butchered, and once butchered, they can be
	  used either in the mod's shellfish recipes or as meat ingredients in any
	  other recipes.
	- Shellfish trap frames, as well as blueprints and finished traps, now block
	  placement of new traps within close proximity.
	
- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.

- 12/03/2017
	- Updated the Japanese language translation files again.

- 12/03/2017
	- Fixed the sushi recipe. (It now requires rice and a *different* type of
	  plant food, instead of just rice and *any* plant food, so pawns will no
	  longer try to use the same rice to fill both requirements.)
	- The minimum required distance between fishing spots has been reduced from
	  12 tiles to 9 tiles. (The minimum distance between traps remains 6 tiles.)
	- The chance of successfully catching a fish, especially in harsher biomes,
	  is no longer quite as low as it was, though it hasn't been returned all
	  the way to its pre-b18 value.
	- Updated the shrimp and snail graphics.

- 11/26/2017
	- There is now always at least some chance of success when fishing. (Prior
	  to this, there was actually a possibility that a low-skill pawn in a harsh
	  biome could stand around trying to fish and actually have no chance at all
	  of actually catching anything.)
	- Moved fishing on the work tab so instead of being just below handling, it
	  is just below hunting, which makes a bit more sense.

- 11/19/2017
	- Updated the "Vegetable Garden" seafood patches.

- 11/13/2017
	- All fish and seafood corpses are now grouped together in a "fish corpses"
	  subfolder within the "animal corpses" folder, for easier stockpile 
	  maintenance.
	- Added Chinese language translation files provided by kghostSATORI.
	- Updated Proxyer's Japanese language files.
	
- 11/12/2017
	- Added Japanese language translation files by Proxyer.
	
- 11/07/2017
	- Made a few minor adjustments to the "harsh biome" penalties to make them
	  consistent with biome animal densities and to ensure all archipelago types
	  are handled properly.

- 11/06/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.
	- Fishing is now a unique work type, rather than a handling job. It still
	  uses the Animals skill, though.
	- The chance of catching fish (either by fishing or with traps) has been
	  reduced, especially in harsher biomes, to try to make the mod a bit less
	  overpowered.
	- It is no longer possible to gaze at water as a joy activity from fishing
	  spots, since "watergazing spots" are available in "Basic Bridges," anyway.
	  So your fishers should no longer find themselves kept from work by lazy
	  folk idly standing in their fishing spots.

- 09/24/2017
	- Set the priority of fishing below that of training, making it the lowest-
	  priority Handling task.
	- Fishing spots use the new watergazing spot graphic, and so no longer stand
	  out visually.
	- It's now possible to catch non-generic freshwater fish in "Archipelagos"
	  biomes as well as in vanilla biomes. (Ocean fish were already available.)
	
- 08/29/2017
	- Initial release of "Fishing" as a separate mod dependent upon "Basic 
	  Bridges").
	- Fishing is now a handling rather than a hunting work type, and so uses the
	  Animals skill rather than Melee and Shooting skills, and can be done by any
	  pawn assigned to handling.
	- Eel and squid leather are now properly part of the leather "stuff" category
	  rather than the fabric category.
	- Shellfish are now categorized as raw food rather than as corpses, since
	  they don't need to be (and in fact can't be) butchered.  Raw fish, on the
	  other hand, are still categorized as corpses, as like other animal corpses,
	  they do need to be butchered.

- 07/03/2017
	- Added shellfish traps.
	  
- 05/14/2017
	- Added the ability to create "fishing spots."
	  
- 05/06/2017
	- Initial release of "Basic Bridges" mod for RimWorld a17.
