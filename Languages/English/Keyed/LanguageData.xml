	<RBB.FishersHaulTip>If this is checked, fishing pawns will stop every time they catch something and haul it to a nearby storage area. This will make fishing less efficient, but will prevent other pawns from being interrupted from their own tasks to haul fish instead.</RBB.FishersHaulTip>

	<RBB.UseRecipes>Use Seafood Recipes.</RBB.UseRecipes>
	<RBB.UseRecipesTip>If this option is unchecked, the mod's seafood recipes will no longer appear as bills at stoves. This will keep the bills list shorter. (Fish and shellfish meat will of course still be usable as ingredients in vanilla meals.) Note that changes to this setting require a game restart before they will take effect.</RBB.UseRecipesTip>
